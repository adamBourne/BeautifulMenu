- Works on both touch-screen and mouse.
- Scroll-up and down with touch/mouse-drag gestures. 
- Vertical momentum included for fast scrolling.
- Automatically shifts menu horizontally to align to currently opened nested level of menu. 
- Arbitrarily nested menu which is essentially an XML reader employing CSS and JavaScript. 
- Normal HTML can be added inside menu, e.g. text area with go buttons.
